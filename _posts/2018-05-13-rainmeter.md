Rainmeter is a free and open-source desktop customization utility for Windows, released under the GNU GPL v2 licence. It allows users to create and display user-generated customizable desktop widgets or applets called "skins" that display information. Ready to use collections of skins can be downloaded and installed in packages known as "suites".

Common functionalities of Rainmeter skins include desktop clocks, RSS readers, system monitors, weather widgets, application launchers, and audio players.
